Experimenting with the Plumber API created by Trestle Technology, LLC 2017 for R



"The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the dominant medium by which information is exchanged on the Internet. An Application Programming Interface (API) is a broad term that defines the rules that guide your interaction with some software. In the case of HTTP APIs, you have a defined set of endpoints that accept particular inputs. Plumber translates the annotations you place on your functions into an HTTP API that can be called from other machines on your network. If you execute your Plumber API on a public server, you can even make your API available to the public Internet."
